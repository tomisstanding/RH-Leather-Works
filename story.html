        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>What started as an idea, quickly transformed into a passion. RH Leather Works started in early 2017 as a handmade leather wallet company. Often people tend to overlook their wallet as a part of their outfit, and have had for 5 plus years with the stitching falling apart and the materials barely hanging on. We understand that a wallet is an investment and we want to be able to make product for people that will stand the test of time and hold up no matter what. We are dedicated to making sure every detail is up to our standards and putting out product we are proud to put our name on. We take pride in the fact that our products are hand made from the first to the last step of the process, and believe that every product we make is as unique as the individual purchasing it. Austin is a big part of this company, not only because it is where we are from, but it has helped shape what the company has become. Every product we make is heavily influenced by a destination in Austin, whether it be the name of the wallet or the color of the thread and the dye, it all pays homage to the community. Austin is a fast-growing city and we want to support that where we can, thatâ€™s why all our leather and supplies are purchased from companies in the city..</p>
